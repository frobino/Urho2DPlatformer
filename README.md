# How to build the engine

    sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libasound2-dev git cmake make libgl1-mesa-dev
    git clone https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D
    cd Urho3D

Alternative 1:

    mkdir build & cd build & cmake ../ & make

Alternative 2 (similar to project creation):

    // Build using classic cpp compiler
    cd script & ./cmake_generic.sh ../build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
    cd ../build & bear -- make

    // Build to Wasm using emcc compiler
    cd script & ./cmake_emscripten.sh ../build/ -DEMSCRIPTEN_ROOT_PATH=/home/${USER}/Tools/emsdk/upstream/emscripten
    cd ../build & bear -- make

Before building a game linked to Urho3D do always add the following env var:

    export URHO3D_HOME=/home/${USER}/Projects/Urho3D/build

# How to create project:

1. mkdir Urho3DSampleProject & cd Urho3DSampleProject
2. cp -r /home/user/Projects/Urho3D/bin .
3. cp -r /home/user/Projects/Urho3D/CMake .
4. cp -r /home/user/Projects/Urho3D/script .
5. create CMakeLists.txt (using the [template](https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.6/_using_library.html)).
6. create src/ folder and put inside main.cpp
7. cd script & ./cmake_generic.sh ../build
8. cd ../build & bear -- make

To create a debuggable binary, use the following in step 7:

7. cd script & ./cmake_generic.sh ../build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

Note that the above steps can be automated using rake. See [documentation](https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.6/_using_library.html).

# How to browse the code:

The "main" can be found where the URHO3D_DEFINE_APPLICATION_MAIN(..applicationName..) macro is.
It expands to something like:

    int RunApplication()
    {
      Urho3D::SharedPtr<Urho3D::Context> context(new Urho3D::Context());
      Urho3D::SharedPtr<className> application(new className(context));
      return application->Run();
    }

src/Urho2DPlatformer:
- the "main"
- provides *Setup()* and *Start()* method to the engine, so that the loop can be initiated
- it uses much of the *Sample2D* class methods to create scene nodes (such as characters), populate the scene, and play effects.
- NOTE:
  - Urho2DPlatformer is a subclass of Sample (see below)
  - Sample is a subclass of Application, the Urho3D base class **needed** to initiate the engine

src/Sample:
- class used to setup the window in which the game will run
- e.g. **DebugHud** is instantiated and configured here (with F2 key we toggle all profilers)

src/Utilities2D/Sample2D:
- helper class, used to create scene nodes (such as characters), populate the scene, and play effects.
- has methods to instantiate sprites of characters, etc.
- *Sample2D* is used to avoid that the main *Urho2DPlatformer* gets too big.

src/Character2D:
- class used to represent the main player / hero of the game (Imp)
- derives from Urho3D::LogicComponent class
- contains some fields as boolean parameters such as _isKilled, etc.
- override Update() method to update the behavior of the character at each frame

src/Utilities2D/Mover:
- Mover logic component
  - Handles entity (enemy, platform...) translation along a path (set of Vector2 points)
  - Supports looping paths and animation flip
  - Default speed is 0.8 if 'Speed' property is not set in the tmx file objects

bin/CoreData/ (partly copied from engine folder):
- contain resources needed from the engine. See [documentation](https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.4/_main_loop.html).
- this is not something an end user needs to write,
  but when running the an application linked to Urho3D engine
  expects to find these files.

bin/Data:
- contains Fonts, Scenes, Sounds, Textures, characters pngs, ...

- bin/Data/Textures/
  - contains pics used for background, logos, etc.

- bin/Data/Scenes/
  - **NOTE**: this folder and the contained xml file is currently **generated** by the cpp program. See *Urho2DPlatformer::HandleSceneRendered* and *Urho2DPlatformer::CreateScene*.
  Info on how to create the inital scene are taken from *bin/Data/Urho2D/Tilesets/* tmx file,
  see below.
  - contains the main scene xml to be created/edited/opened with **Editor**

- bin/Data/Urho2D/ contains pngs for the characters, etc. NOTE: sprites and animation are generated using [Spriter](http://www.brashmonkey.com/spriter.htm).

    E.g.

        Sample2D::CreateCharacter(...)
          // Get scml file and Play "idle" anim
          auto* animationSet = cache->GetResource<AnimationSet2D>("Urho2D/imp/imp.scml");
          // scml files specifies hoe the png pieces are connected to create a character, // it describes animations (i.e. how png pieces moves in different circumstances), etc.

- bin/Data/Urho2D/Tilesets/
  - contains blocks used to create the tile (png files)
  - contains a tmx file describing how to interpret the png and **how to place the blocks to create the level**.

# How to use the tools around Urho3D engine

## Editor

The editor is found in *URHO3D_HOME/build/bin/Editor.sh*. This is a script that executes the following tool:

```
Urho3DPlayer Scripts/Editor.as
```

where *Editor.as* in an AngelScript script.

When executing Editor.sh, the editor opens and we can select the scene (e.g. *bin/Data/Urho2D/Platformer2D.xml*).

## Profiler and Tracy

Urho3D contains a profiler library, which is built by default
when the engine is built.

Results from the profiler can be shown and interpreted using
the [DebugHud](https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/wiki/DebugHud-and-Profiling),
an inbuilt utility for profiling, measuring and displaying scene,
memory or other runtime statistics.
To see DebugHud in action use F2 and F3 on Urho3Dâ€™s samples.

An alternative to the default profiler is [Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy).
To use Tracy, we need first to build **both** the engine and the game
using the option URHO3D_TRACY_PROFILING:

    cd script & ./cmake_generic.sh ../build -DURHO3D_TRACY_PROFILING=1

NOTE: URHO3D_PROFILING will be automatically turned off when URHO3D_TRACY_PROFILING is on.

Then we can build and start the Tracy server (a.k.a. profiler):

```
sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev
sudo apt-get install libfreetype-dev
sudo apt-get install libcapstone-dev
sudo apt install build-essential g++ cmake git-all \
    liblzma-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev liblzma-dev \
    libboost-date-time-dev libboost-program-options-dev \
    libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev \
    libboost-iostreams-dev
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev
git clone https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy.git
cd tracy/profiler/build/unix
make release
./Tracy-release
```

See [install instructions](https://www.gear-genomics.com/docs/tracy/installation/#installation-from-source)
and [pull request description](https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/tracy-profiler-integration-for-urho3d/6627/17)

# 2D Physics

## Body collision example:

Urho2D implements rigid body physics simulation using the [Box2D](http://box2d.org/manual.pdf) library.

Urho2DPlatformer.cpp:
```
void Urho2DPlatformer::SubscribeToEvents()
{
    ...
    // Subscribe to Box2D contact listeners
    SubscribeToEvent(E_PHYSICSBEGINCONTACT2D, URHO3D_HANDLER(Urho2DPlatformer, HandleCollisionBegin));
    ...
}
```

In the **engine**:

Source/Urho3D/Urho2D/PhysicsWorld2D.cpp:
```
// Implement b2ContactListener from Box2D.
// BeginContact is called when two fixtures begin to touch.
//
// See b2Contact::Update(b2ContactListener* listener), which calls BeginContact!
// How Box2D identifies collisions (raycasting or other tech is still unclear to me)
void PhysicsWorld2D::BeginContact(b2Contact* contact)
{
    ...
    beginContactInfos_.Push(ContactInfo(contact));
    ...
}

void PhysicsWorld2D::SendBeginContactEvents()
{
  for (unsigned i = 0; i < beginContactInfos_.Size(); ++i)
  {
      ContactInfo& contactInfo = beginContactInfos_[i];
      eventData[P_BODYA] = contactInfo.bodyA_.Get();
      ...
      SendEvent(E_PHYSICSBEGINCONTACT2D, eventData);
      ...
  }
}
```

## Raycast example:

Source/Urho3D/Urho2D/PhysicsWorld2D.cpp:
```
// Return in "result" parameter
void PhysicsWorld2D::RaycastSingle(PhysicsRaycastResult2D& result, const Vector2& startPoint, const Vector2& endPoint, unsigned collisionMask)
{
    ...
    SingleRayCastCallback callback(result, startPoint, collisionMask);
    world_->RayCast(&callback, ToB2Vec2(startPoint), ToB2Vec2(endPoint));
}
```

Box2D/Collision/Shapes/b2collision.cpp - Similar to the one I developed:
```
// Collision Detection in Interactive 3D Environments by Gino van den Bergen
// From Section 3.1.2
// x = s + a * r
// norm(x) = radius
bool b2CircleShape::RayCast(b2RayCastOutput* output, const b2RayCastInput& input,
							const b2Transform& transform, int32 childIndex) const
{
  ... similar to the one I developed...
}
```
